# ScoreCounter
This is one of my first developed android apps. It is quite simple but functional. ScoreCounter helps to count scores for two competing basketball teams. The app uses mainly buttons to calculate scores, as well as refresh the result.

Credits
ScoreCounter was developed to learn how to make app interactive. I've used Android Basics: User input(https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-button-clicks--ud836) course excersizes in order to learn and complete this project. Color scheme was inspired by Lakers basketball team.
